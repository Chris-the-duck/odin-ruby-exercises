I've put all the little Ruby Programming projects from The Odin Project's Ruby
path together here as "exercises" as they aren't really complex enough to count
as "projects".

That last one kept me busy for a while. Mostly because I've done things like put
together Hangman games in Python courses before, but they'd always just be a pile
of functions and I wasn't entirely sure what the benefit of using objects for this
was. I've made a mock-up of a text adventure game where the player character and
rooms are objects before, but didn't really see how this would benefit from it.

But fine, the game is an object and (most of) the pile of functions is inside it. I am
very much looking forward to being able to check solutions.
